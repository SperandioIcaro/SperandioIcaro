##  About Me 


Student of systems analysis and development and game design. 

Curious by nature, I like to always look for new things to help me improve.
the applications I develop or even create new solutions.
I always have an idea in mind for a game, graphic art or website/app development.
I've been studying a lot about React and I intend to study UI/UX, as I know it will make me evolve a lot more in my front-end development.
